# ggmap-mpg
A basic ggmap with coordinates set to MPG Ranch

To use the required API key user will need to make a secrets directory in their home folder containing a 'secret.json' file.  
The file should be in JSON format containing a static map api-key obtained from Google Console.

The contents of the 'secret.json' should look like this

{
  "mpg_google_key" : "Ajbk-key-some7extendedalpha0numericsequence"
}
